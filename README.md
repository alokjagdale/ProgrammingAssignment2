# create a *square* matrix (because `solve` only handles square matrices)
# create the matrix during the call of makeCacheMatrix()
#a <- makeCacheMatrix( matrix(c(1,2,12,13), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) );
#cacheSolve() will check if the inverse is cached ealier and gets the vlaue from cache if not avaialable 
# uses solve() function to calculate inverse.
